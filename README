Mail Engine for App Engine

You can deploy this as your own Google App Engine app and have an email service for any app you want. Messages are sent via a simple restful interface, just POST the following to the root path the App Engine app you run this service on:
- recipients - comma separated list of email addresses
- subject - The email subject
- body - The email body
- token - A SHA1 hash of the key/values you've posted, in alphabetical order by key and url encoded, with a secret key you configure concated to the end. something like:
	> hashlib.sha1(urllib.urlencode(PARAMS.sort()) + SECRET).hexdigest()

Make sure you configure the SECRET in settings.py, as well as an email address associated with the App Engine app.

It's a simple service for now, but hopefully useful, and I'll add more to it as I am able
